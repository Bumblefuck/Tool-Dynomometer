# Tool-Dynomometer
This is the arduino sketch for measuring rpm, ramp time and ultimately the power output of tool. 
Initial sketch plucked from http://elimelecsarduinoprojects.blogspot.ca/2013/06/measure-rpms-arduino.html
Thank you Elimelec!
But we'll need to add a  ramp time and decel time as well as corelate that to the mass of the ass in order to calculate teh heat
of the meat.
